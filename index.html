        <p>
            I am a junior student studying Computer Science with a Mathematics minor at the University 
            of Wisconsin - La Crosse. My primary interests include Web Development, Software Development, 
            and Artificial Intelligence. I am currently seeking out internships to apply the skills I have 
            learned as well as gain experience in my field of study. A few of my hobbies include running, 
            biking, playing basketball, and learning different programming languages. This personal CV website 
            is a component of a three-part project that demonstrates my knowledge and skills in Computer Science. 
            The first part is my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-krause-b6aa21179/">LinkedIn profile</a>, 
            the second part is my <a href="https://github.com/Krause2023">GitHub homepage</a>, and the third 
            part is this CV website. My CV lists the knowledge and skills I have acquired in Computer Science.
            Additional details such as contact information are also provided.
