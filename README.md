## Description
**_Website to Show all my Completed Computer Science Courses_** <br/>
My Curriculum Vitae (CV) page was the very first website that I published on the world wide web. It consists of a simplistic pages built completely of HTML. The website contains courses I have taken to further my understanding in Computer Science. The information included consists of courses from my college, the University of Wisconsin - La Crosse, courses from an online learning platform called Udemy, and courses from an online learning platform called Mosh. I included my work history with businesses as a cashier and backstock worker (I know that this is rather random). I also ranked my proficiency in different programming languages, listed in the "Skills" section of the page, out of five stars. The "Skills" section is close to the bottom of the webpage and directly above two links at the bottom of the webpage. The two links at the bottom of the webpage bring you to a "My Hobbies" page, and a "Contact Me" page.
